# randomWorkoutCreator
<i>A workout plan creator made to avoid routine and simplify training process. Currently only works on Windows (tested on 10).</i>

Ever felt too lazy to make a workout plan? Or that your workouts get boring?
Look no further, this app will solve these two problems, making a random (but still structured) workout plan and in a matter of seconds!
It also emails the plan to you (so that you could use it from your phone).

Additionally, workout schedule/plan should change regularly, to avoid muscle adaptation (that is, your body gets used to the excercises you are doing and focuses on your 
    performance in only these movements, limiting overall progression).

What this app does:
  * lets the user pick up to 3 excercise groups/types (can be redefined by the user)
  * chooses a random sample from each of the groups of size n (can also be changed by the user)
  * sends the created workout to user-specified email (or saves it to .txt file)
  
NOTES:
  * This app was NOT designed to be used without prior knowledge of basic excercise planning and avoiding common injuries, use at you own responsibility.
  * The methods are currently defined by my (author) personal goals and thereby may need to be altered before use.
  
CRITICAL! Please use a disposable mail address for sender_email!
  * There is no security whatsoever to protect your personal data through this app, so don't use your personal email to send the plans
