# randomWorkoutCreator
A workout plan creator made to avoid routine.

A workout schedule/plan should change regularly, to avoid muscle adaptation (that is, your body gets used to the excercises you are doing and focuses on your 
    performance in only these movements, limiting overall progression).

What this app does:
  *.txt files stored in resources/excercises/ correspond to all excercises available for a given muscle group.
  * the main function chooses a random sample of size n from all chosen muscle groups and emails the plan to user email account
  ** in order for this to work, define your *disposable* mail address in the 'treeningkava_main.py' (just add correct values to sender_email and password)
  
NOTES:
  *This app was NOT designed to be used without prior knowledge of basic excercise planning and avoiding common injuries, use at you own responsibility.
  *The methods are currently defined by my (author) personal goals and thereby may need to be altered before use.
  
  ***CRITICAL! Please use a disposable mail address for sender_email! Why:
  *There is no sequrity whatsoever to protect your personal data through this app, so don't use your personal email to send the plans
